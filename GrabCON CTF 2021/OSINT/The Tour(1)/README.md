# The Tour(1)
## Description

w0nd3r50uL! I know her but she did something horrible! She recently switched to some free and open-source software for running self-hosted social networking services. Check out her profile and find the last location she visited when she felt hungry?

## Solution
Look at description we see some interest keywords : `w0nd3r50uL` `open-source software` `self-hosted social networking services`

Investigation :
 1. `w0nd3r50uL` is look like a username, profile, or url directory,location or address of any website
 2. Since `open-source software` and `self-hosted social networking services` keywords is about social media platform that she used, we can define that `w0nd3r50uL` is a username, profile or user address of social media platform.

So first we use a google search engine to find a `w0nd3r50uL` user, unfortunately that user was delete from [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/w0nd3r50uL/) platform and we try a [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20210904191920/https://www.reddit.com/user/w0nd3r50uL/) to look up any backup but nothing found. So we try a username search engine to find her again.

We don't want to miss something, everything on internet can be delete so we try to find some backup.

Surprise, we see a post that she delete. So now move back to our scope ``Check out her profile and find the last location she visited when she felt hungry?``

We see her last post about food. So how can we find that location? ``Reverse image search`` is very useful.

We see the similar image which was upload into this website and we notice the title of this website is a location which was in ``Serbia``. So we check that website and we don't see any flag. ``Why don't we try the popular once?``

Look at info, we see a ``879`` reviews. Let's try to search a flag in the reviews.
